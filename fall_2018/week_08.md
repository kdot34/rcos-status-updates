## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I started programming the lecture exercises. I had a slight issue as I don't really use npm or anything like that and had to figure that out. About halfway done. I think my logic is correct but I will ask the mentors. Also we are preparing for our presentaion in the upcoming weeks.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

Finish programming the lecture exercises.
Start preparing for presentation, finish slides and make sure that I have my contributions documented and ready to present.

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

No, all my questions I can either Google or ask my mentor.

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes
Went to large group last week but missed the code for RPISEC

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
