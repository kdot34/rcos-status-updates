## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished the looping exercise. Not sure if it's the best for the kids, because like I said I don't want it to be copy paste, however, I think it is helpful enough and will be able to be used as a capable learning tool.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

Finalize all documentation and figure out what to commit, so that it can be continued next year. Also meet with the rest of the curriculum team to make sure that we have everything set for anybody joining ht project next semester.

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

Finding time to meet will be a bit difficult. We will probably just meet in small group since the group is so big. Hopefully we finish everything.

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes
Went to large group last week but missed the code for RPISEC

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
