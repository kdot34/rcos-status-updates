## Last Week's Accomplishments

I haven't updated in a few weeks, my apologies. I was here last week but forgot ot to update and the week before there was no small group so I didn't update for that either.

This week I have been working on familiarizing myself more with React. Last week we alos started talking about the curriculum nd hte progression that it could potentially take. So far we have a couple paths and I googled a bit to see if any of these had been created yet. 
> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

Continue familiarizing with web tech. I'm not a web dev or itws major so this is all very new.

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

No, for the most part everything is going well. I fell a bit behind on my work this week but that's just because I underestimated how much I had to do. 

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
