## Last Week's Accomplishments

I was assigneed the looping exercises after the last smallgroup meeting so i have been looking at different examples and exercises to see what works and what doesn't. I don't want to create an exercise that seems like it's just copy paste so I've been looking at how to make a more intuitive exercise. 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

Start programming the lecture exercises.

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

Figuring out how to make my exercise a proper learning tool rather than copypasta.

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
