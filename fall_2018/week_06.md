## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I looked up some examples that we could use for the project. We had talked about games such as connect 4, checkers, and chess so I looked up examples that had been done in React so that we could have a template when we get to that point. 

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

Look up some more examples and continue to look at React examples.

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

No everythings is going pretty well. I do have to study for a test on Friday but aside from that I should be good.

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
